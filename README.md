[00:09.92] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[00:16.41] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[00:22.85] Baby, baby, love me, love you
[00:37.35] 
[00:28.84] A great silence reigns over the night
[00:31.88] Try to reach out my hands toward this
[00:34.15] Lovely moonlight falling upon my face
[00:38.99] Watch my steps through the dark passage
[00:58.49] 
[00:41.42] Did you catch a scent of danger?
[00:44.38] There is nobody to save you but yourself
[00:48.33] Leave all the fear on the farthest shelf
[00:51.68] Move to another place to be a stranger again
[01:13.68] 
[00:55.25] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[00:58.43] Know you by sight but not by your name
[01:01.47] Shut both my eyes to feel a little
[01:03.67] Closer to your voices and to my heartbeat
[01:24.17] 
[01:07.95] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[01:11.16] Would anyone speed up the time for me?
[01:14.27] Just can't wait to have you until daybreak
[01:17.45] I must have been lost in the night fog
[01:36.45] 
[01:46.26] (Baby, baby) Time to dance to the beat
[01:49.22] (Trace it, trace it) There is nothing to lose
[01:52.59] (Love me, love me) Would you give me a kiss?
[01:55.43] I would keep it a secret, we are running out of time
[01:58.95] (Baby, baby) Our night is so tasty
[02:01.94] (Trace it, trace it) All I wanted is you
[02:05.38] (Love me, love me) Write the rest of the story
[02:08.23] Please tell me how you feel, we got lost in the night fog
[02:36.73] 
[02:14.12] Out of town
[02:17.94] Baby, baby, (baby, baby) trace it, trace it
[02:22.50] I would keep it secret
[02:24.39] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[02:30.87] Baby, baby, love me, love you
[02:45.37] 
[02:36.42] A great silence reigns over the night
[02:39.73] Try to reach out my hands toward this
[02:41.82] Lovely moonlight falling upon my face
[02:46.81] Watch my steps through the dark passage
[03:06.31] 
[02:49.39] Did you catch a scent of danger?
[02:52.51] There is nobody to save you but yourself
[02:56.53] Leave all the fear on the farthest shelf
[02:59.77] Move to another place to be a stranger again
[03:21.77] 
[03:03.25] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[03:06.52] Know you by sight but not by your name
[03:09.42] Shut both my eyes to feel a little
[03:11.88] Closer to your voices and to my heartbeat
[03:32.38] 
[03:15.89] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[03:19.00] Would anyone speed up the time for me?
[03:22.33] Just can't wait to have you until daybreak
[03:25.56] I must have been lost in the night fog
[03:44.56] 
[03:55.06] (Baby, baby) Time to dance to the beat
[03:57.29] (Trace it, trace it) There is nothing to lose
[04:00.52] (Love me, love me) Would you give me a kiss?

[04:16.03] Please tell me how you feel, we got lost in the night fog
[04:44.53] 
[04:20.94] Our night is so tasty, all I wanted is you
[04:28.07] Oh, would you love me?
[04:30.25] We got lost in the night fog
[04:44.25] 
[04:32.69] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[04:38.88] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
