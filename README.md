[00:09.90] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[00:16.44] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[00:22.83] Baby, baby, love me, love you
[00:37.33] 
[00:28.87] A great silence reigns over the night
[00:31.81] Try to reach out my hands toward this
[00:34.13] Lovely moonlight falling upon my face
[00:38.92] Watch my steps through the dark passage
[00:58.42] 
[00:41.43] Did you catch a scent of danger?
[00:44.31] There is nobody to save you but yourself
[00:48.34] Leave all the fear on the farthest shelf
[00:51.68] Move to another place to be a stranger again
[01:13.68] 
[00:55.20] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[00:58.48] Know you by sight but not by your name
[01:01.48] Shut both my eyes to feel a little
[01:03.65] Closer to your voices and to my heartbeat
[01:24.15] 
[01:07.95] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[01:11.19] Would anyone speed up the time for me?
[01:14.24] Just can't wait to have you until daybreak
[01:17.41] I must have been lost in the night fog
[01:36.41] 
[01:46.29] (Baby, baby) Time to dance to the beat
[01:49.25] (Trace it, trace it) There is nothing to lose
[01:52.52] (Love me, love me) Would you give me a kiss?
[01:55.42] I would keep it a secret, we are running out of time
[01:58.94] (Baby, baby) Our night is so tasty
[02:01.98] (Trace it, trace it) All I wanted is you
[02:05.34] (Love me, love me) Write the rest of the story
[02:08.29] Please tell me how you feel, we got lost in the night fog
[02:36.79] 
[02:14.15] Out of town
[02:17.94] Baby, baby, (baby, baby) trace it, trace it
[02:22.50] I would keep it secret
[02:24.39] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[02:30.85] Baby, baby, love me, love you
[02:45.35] 
[02:36.44] A great silence reigns over the night
[02:39.71] Try to reach out my hands toward this
[02:41.83] Lovely moonlight falling upon my face
[02:46.86] Watch my steps through the dark passage
[03:06.36] 
[02:49.35] Did you catch a scent of danger?
[02:52.55] There is nobody to save you but yourself
[02:56.50] Leave all the fear on the farthest shelf
[02:59.76] Move to another place to be a stranger again
[03:21.76] 
[03:03.20] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[03:06.59] Know you by sight but not by your name
[03:09.46] Shut both my eyes to feel a little
[03:11.88] Closer to your voices and to my heartbeat
[03:32.38] 
[03:15.87] Seemed to hear your voices from far away
[03:19.02] Would anyone speed up the time for me?
[03:22.32] Just can't wait to have you until daybreak
[03:25.57] I must have been lost in the night fog
[03:44.57] 
[03:55.06] (Baby, baby) Time to dance to the beat
[03:57.24] (Trace it, trace it) There is nothing to lose
[04:00.56] (Love me, love me) Would you give me a kiss?
[04:02.91] I would keep it a secret, we are running out of time
[04:07.16] (Baby, baby) Our night is so tasty

[04:16.06] Please tell me how you feel, we got lost in the night fog
[04:44.56] 
[04:20.94] Our night is so tasty, all I wanted is you
[04:28.05] Oh, would you love me?
[04:30.20] We got lost in the night fog
[04:44.20] 
[04:32.68] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
[04:38.85] Baby, baby, trace it, trace it
